Where is alpha?  
- willing to do work that others can't because of constraint  

What are constraints?  
- Operational Constraints  
    - Regional Constraints (how to set up bank to receive foreign funds)  
    - Being a local helps to find ways  
    - Look at local exchanges

- Capacity vs skill  
    - limited capacity in niche trades not exploited by institutional firms
    - dominate a niche
    - Estimate the capacity of a market

- Risk premiums
    - scenarios to take a risk off someone's hands
    - some premiums are bigger than risks
    - Constraint in risk estimation (knowledge-gap)
    - Good at estimating risk  

- Mixing edges/taking timed opportunities
    - instutional firms not market make for rare scenarios
    - prepare tooling for strategies (tech edge)
    - wait for timing (time edge)
