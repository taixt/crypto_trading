### A coding project

## Where is alpha?  
- willing to do work that others can't because of constraint  

## What are constraints?  
- Operational Constraints  
    - Regional Constraints (how to set up bank to receive foreign funds)  
    - Being a local helps to find ways  
    - Look at local exchanges

- Capacity vs skill  
    - limited capacity in niche trades not exploited by institutional firms
    - dominate a niche
    - Estimate the capacity of a market

- Risk premiums
    - scenarios to take a risk off someone's hands
    - some premiums are bigger than risks
    - Constraint in risk estimation (knowledge-gap)
    - Good at estimating risk  

- Mixing edges/taking timed opportunities
    - instutional firms not market make for rare scenarios
    - prepare tooling for strategies (tech edge)
    - wait for timing (time edge)

## Details:

- Local cross-exchange arbitrage:
    - Buy here, send there, sell there, get money, convert, then send here.
    - Is it legal?

- Event based alpha
    - make a scrape bot for news and price movement
    - do sentimental analysis
    - think about expectation and odds (be ready for low odds -> high return)
    - focus on getting data fast, execution matters less
    - Data sources:
      - Custom Scrapers (building a scraper for CNN and such): fast but need to write yourself/chatGPT
      - Direct Use (I.e. Twitter with Tweets)
      - Prediction Markets
      - Faster Markets
      - Price Data / Volume Stuff
    - Spreads kill. Getting in late = wide spreads

- small capacity shitcoin arbitrage
  - quantifying capacity & risk
  - arbitrage how?
